# hackerrank-c-practice

This repository contains my solutions to various C programming problems solved on HackerRank.

### 📌 Topics Covered
- Warmup problems
- Arrays and Strings
- Loops and Conditional Logic
- Functions etc

### 📆 Progress
I am solving one problem per day (or more when I can) and pushing regularly to keep track of my learning.

### 🛠️ Language Used
- C Programming

### 🧠 Goal
Build strong problem-solving skills in C 


### ⚠️ Note
Most HackerRank problems provide their own input/output handling.  
So, my solutions here mainly focus on the **core logic inside the function** (not full `main()` programs).
